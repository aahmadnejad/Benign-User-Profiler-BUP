# Installation

You must install the requirements in your system before you can begin installing or running anything. To do so, you can easily run this command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You are now ready to install BenignUserProfiler. In order to do so, you should run this command, which will install the BenignUserProfiler package in your system:

```bash
python3 setup.py install
```

# Usage

## Standard Execution

To execute the program with simulated traffic, run this command:

```bash
benign-user-profiler
```

You can use `-h` to see different options of the program:

```bash
# Run with default config file
benign-user-profiler

# Run with a specific config file
benign-user-profiler --config /path/to/config.json

# Run with parallel execution
benign-user-profiler --parallel

# Run with work hours restrictions (9am-5pm by default)
benign-user-profiler --work-hours

# Run with custom work hours
benign-user-profiler --work-hours "10:00-18:00"

# Run with randomized task execution (shuffles task order regardless of start times)
benign-user-profiler --randomize
```

## Real Traffic Generation

For realistic traffic generation with actual browser interaction, use the included script:

```bash
# Run with real browser interaction
./run_real_traffic.sh

# Run in headless mode (no visible browser windows)
./run_real_traffic.sh --headless

# Run in simulation mode (no real browser interaction)
./run_real_traffic.sh --simulate
```

### Requirements for Real Traffic

Real traffic generation has the following dependencies:

#### Linux:
- Firefox browser
- xdotool (for keyboard/mouse simulation)
- LibreOffice (for document creation)

#### Windows:
- Firefox browser
- PowerShell (for application control)
- Microsoft Office (for document creation)

The `run_real_traffic.sh` script will check for these dependencies and warn you if any are missing.

## Configuration

The tool is configured via a JSON file (`config.json`). Here's a sample configuration:

```json

  "web_browsing": {
    "type": "HTTP",
    "randomize": true,
    "websites": [
      "https://www.wikipedia.org",

    },
    "frequency": 2,

      "notepad.exe",
      "explorer.exe"
    ],
    "min_apps_to_open": 2,
    "max_apps_to_open": 4,
    "app_use_time_min": 30,
    "app_use_time_max": 300,
    "frequency": 2,
    "time_interval": [1800, 3600]
  },
  "microsoft_office": {
    "type": "CMD",
    "windows_commands": [
      {
        "command": "start winword",
        "platform": "windows",
        "description": "Open Microsoft Word",
        "use_time": [120, 600]
      }
    ],
    "create_office_docs": true,
    "frequency": 1,
    "time_interval": [5400, 10800]
  }
}
```

See `config.json` for a complete example with all supported protocols.

### Task Scheduling and Randomization

By default, tasks are scheduled and executed based on their start times. You can enable task randomization in two ways:

1. Using the `--randomize` command-line flag: This will randomize all tasks regardless of their configured start times.
2. Setting `"randomize": true` in individual model configurations: This allows you to control which specific tasks/models should be randomized.

When randomization is enabled, tasks will be executed in a random order rather than strictly by their start times. This creates more realistic and less predictable traffic patterns.

This project has been successfully tested on Ubuntu 22.04. It should work on other versions of Ubuntu OS (or even Debian OS) as long as your system has the necessary python3 packages (you can see the required packages in the `requirements.txt` file).
